		<h2>The Toronto Maple Leafs Efforts During the Pandemic</h2>
		<p>Toronto Maple Leafs players donated funds to support workers at two Toronto-area hospitals. The hospitals will use the funds to feed frontline employees and to run an emergency room training simulation.
Scotiabank Arena has transformed into Toronto's largest kitchen and is preparing up to 10,000 meals a day for frontline healthcare workers and community agencies.
Alternate captain Mitch Marner's personal charity, Marner Assist Fund, has launched a campaign to support pandemic relief. All money raised will combat food insecurity and help first responders who are working on the front lines.
