		<h2>The Toronto Maple Leafs Efforts During the Pandemic</h2>
		<p>Toronto Maple Leafs players donated funds to support workers at two Toronto-area hospitals. The hospitals will use the funds to feed frontline employees and to run an emergency room training simulation.
Scotiabank Arena has transformed into Toronto's largest kitchen and is preparing up to 10,000 meals a day for frontline healthcare workers and community agencies.
Alternate captain Mitch Marner's personal charity, Marner Assist Fund, has launched a campaign to support pandemic relief. All money raised will combat food insecurity and help first responders who are working on the front lines.

		<p>The 31 NHL teams were realigned in four new divisions for the 2021 season, including one for the seven teams based in Canada called the Scotia North Division.
		This division consists of the Montreal Canadiens, Calgary Flames, Edmonton Oilers, Ottawa Senators, Toronto Maple Leafs, Vancouver Canucks and Winnipeg Jets. The 
		realignment was meant to help stop the spread of Covid 19 by only allowing teams of the same division to play each other. Although this limits the amount of travel a 
		team does, there is still a growing number of Covid 19 cases amongst the players as there are still a high number of cases in the host cities.</p>
		<p></p>
		<p>The map on the left shows the number of Covid 19 cases for each Canadian city that hosts a team in the NHL. The cities marked red (Montreal and Toronto) have the most cases,
		the cities marked yellow have the third and fourth most (Edmonton and Calgary) and the the cities marked green have the fewest cases (Ottawa, Winnipeg, and Vancouver).</p>
